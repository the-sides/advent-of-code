# Year 2015: Throwback powered by Bun
In anticipation for 2015 and a desire to code more, I'm going back to the first year of the advent and doing some puzzles. Also using this as a chance to play with Bun more. 

I would like to build a cool CLI app for adding new days, as well as interacting and managing them. Also in effort to learn Bun more and build new/different apps.
