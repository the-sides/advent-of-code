# advent-of-code


2021
---
2021 was done on Codepen. Only made it 4 days, but that can be found here:

https://codepen.io/collection/RzxWLj

2022
---
Attempted in Rust
Finished in Deno (TypeScript)

2015
---
Revisted past years to try out Bun

2023
---
Gave up on using Elm after seeing a lack of a file read system
Pursued mostly with Bun as I had enjoyed that experience a bit more than Deno. Arguably similar from the advent perspective however.
