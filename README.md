# advent-of-code


2021
---
2021 was done on Codepen. Only made it 4 days, but that can be found here:

2022
---
Attempted in Rust
Finished in Deno (TypeScript)

2015
---
Revisted past years to try out Bun

2023
---
Gave up on using Elm after seeing a lack of a file read system
Pursued mostly with Bun as I had enjoyed that experience a bit more than Deno. Arguably similar from the advent perspective however.

2024
--- 
2nd attempt at Rust, completed Day 1. Lost steam and went back to 
DENO 2!!!
